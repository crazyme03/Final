  <h2>Snake</h2>
  <p>The object of Snake is to make the snake (the collection of green squares) eat the cherries (the red square). Each time you eat a cherry, your snake gets longer. You can control your snake using the arrow keys. If your snake runs into itself or into the walls, you lose.</p>
  <p>If you want a perfect bot to play for you, press backspace while the snake is travelling vertically. You can also press backspace to turn the bot off and control snake yourself.</p>
