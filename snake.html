  <h2>Snake</h2>
  <p>The object of Snake is to make the snake (the collection of green squares) eat the cherries (the red square). Each time you eat a cherry, your snake gets longer. Your snake will always move forward, but you can change its direction. This is done with the arrow keys. If your snake runs into itself or into the walls, you lose. If you get enough cherries to fill up the whole board you win.</p>
  <p>If you want a perfect bot to play for you, press backspace while the snake is travelling vertically. You can also press backspace to turn the bot off and control snake yourself.</p>
